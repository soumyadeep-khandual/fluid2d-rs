# Fluid2D

Fluid2D is a project that simulates fluids from first principles using the Smoothed-Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) technique. The main goal was to learn the Rust programming language. This project utilizes the Bevy game engine for rendering and interaction.

## Features
- Real-time fluid simulation
- High-performance rendering using Bevy
- Rayon for parallelization
- Real-time user-changeable interaction strengths

## Prerequisites
- Rust (latest stable version)
- Cargo (comes with Rust)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd fluid2d
   ```
2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```
3. Run the project:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```
